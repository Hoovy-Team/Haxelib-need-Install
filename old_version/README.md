because haxelib is error when using `haxelib install `
and it will gave `Error: Failed with error: X509 - Certificate verification failed, e.g. CRL, CA or signature check failed`

so we need using a manual step, type `haxelib install [library file and version].zip`
E.G: `haxelib install lime-8,0,0.zip`
and do all other library file

or it you lazy to do, using `install.bat`
